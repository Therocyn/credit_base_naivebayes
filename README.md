# Credit analysis ðŸ’¸

Modeling of a machine learning algorithm to predict if a client of a bank will pay the loan using a bayesian classificator.
The algorithm uses as parameters the age, income and loan of the clients. The target is the column "default"(0 to "will pay" and 1 to "will not pay").

In this case, i use both Bayesian Learning, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbor, Logistic Regression, SVM and Neural Networks. Using Cross Validation and comparing all these classifiers it is possible to attest that the Neural Networks classifier has the highest overall precision rate with 99.8%.
